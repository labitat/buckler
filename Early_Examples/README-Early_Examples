accel_id_reader: reads the ADXL345 ID. this should output 0xE5 if SPI communication is working and the accelerometer isn't fried.
diode_single: turn on a single diode
diode_show_char: display a character (from A to Z) on the diode display
diode_scroll_string: scroll a string of characters across the diode display
digital_level: shows the accelerometer X and Y axis input on the diode display

Radio communication is still a work in progress.
