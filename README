The development of "access routines" for the Buckler board.

Msquare june/july 2012:
Buildt on the first attempt by Juul(?) around october 2009,
but it is a total rewrite: Arduino enviroment changes and
split up into files so there is in effect a "library" of functions.

Complete is under development - compiles fine under Arduino v1 (and 0022)
  as one sketch with all 5 files
